Modified from the openweather demo code from Adafruit.

Uses Pyportal from Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116. 


Tracks bus timings from 200 Boston Ave to Tufts University main campus.

If you wish to edit the code you will need to edit the code.py file where you will haveto edit the stop code. Find more information about the bus stops from http://massgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&layers=cef8d0fe8b9d49fe9aa8f1b7524c6ac2. 

You will also subsequently need to update the openweather_graphics.py file too. 

More info coming soon.. maybe!!
